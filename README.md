This is a short example in how we can use a socket with node.js

Download the code or fork it, is up to you.

FIRST:
install sails js like below

npm install sails -g

SECOND:
In the root of the project folder run next line

sails lift

You need 2 windows in your browser (chrome, ff, safari...)
first window

http://localhost:1337
1337 is the port tha you configured for sails (by default is 1337)

second window
http://localhost:1337/emoji/create?text=something

Expected:
the first window must be listening everything and showing all you enter in second or thirds windows.

Thats was super easier and quickly. And the code is not too much.
